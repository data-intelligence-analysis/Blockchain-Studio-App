1. Create a script in Unity that tracks the player's score during a session and updates the highest score if the current score surpasses it.
2. In the `Start` method of the script, connect to MongoDB using the `MongoClient` and `IMongoDatabase` classes from the MongoDB C# driver.
3. In the `Update` method of the script, update the player's current score based on the actual scoring logic of your game.
4. Check if the current score surpasses the highest score. If it does, update the highest score and upload it to MongoDB using the `InsertOne` method of the `IMongoCollection<BsonDocument>` class.
5. In the `BsonDocument1 object that you pass to the `InsertOne` method, include the player's name and the highest score.

Note: make sure to replace the placeholders in the script with the actual values, such as the MongoDB connection string, database name, 
collection name, and player name.
