DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service provided by AWS that uses a key-value store to store and retrieve data. MongoDB is also a NoSQL database, but it uses a document store to store and retrieve data. While DynamoDB and MongoDB have some similarities, they have different data models and query languages, so it is not straightforward to retrieve MongoDB data using DynamoDB.

However, you can use a tool like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to replicate data from MongoDB to DynamoDB. AWS DMS can be used to migrate data from various sources, including MongoDB, to a target database, such as DynamoDB. Once the data is migrated to DynamoDB, you can use the DynamoDB SDK to retrieve the data.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in using AWS DMS to replicate data from MongoDB to DynamoDB:

Set up a MongoDB source endpoint in AWS DMS. You'll need to provide the MongoDB connection information, such as the host, port, and authentication credentials.

Set up a DynamoDB target endpoint in AWS DMS. You'll need to provide the AWS credentials and the target DynamoDB table.

Create a replication instance in AWS DMS. This instance will act as a bridge between the MongoDB source endpoint and the DynamoDB target endpoint.

Create a replication task in AWS DMS. This task will define the replication settings, such as the source and target endpoints, the replication method, and the data transformation rules.

Start the replication task in AWS DMS. This will initiate the data migration process from MongoDB to DynamoDB.

Once the data is migrated to DynamoDB, you can use the DynamoDB SDK to retrieve the data. You'll need to provide the AWS credentials and the DynamoDB table name, and then use the SDK methods to query the table and retrieve the data.

Note that this is just an overview of the process, and there may be additional steps and considerations depending on your specific use case. Also, keep in mind that replicating data from MongoDB to DynamoDB can incur additional costs and may impact the performance of your MongoDB and DynamoDB instances.
