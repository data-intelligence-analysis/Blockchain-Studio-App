To retrieve data from DynamoDB and create charts in QuickSight, you can follow these steps:

Create an IAM role with permissions to access DynamoDB and QuickSight. This role will be used to authenticate with both services.

Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to create a schema for the DynamoDB table. This will enable QuickSight to discover the table and its fields.

In QuickSight, create a new data source using the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Select the DynamoDB table and the IAM role you created in step 1.

In the QuickSight data source, create a new dataset using the fields from the DynamoDB table. You can use the QuickSight data preparation tools to clean and transform the data as needed.

Create a new analysis in QuickSight and add the dataset to it. You can use the QuickSight visualization tools to create charts and graphs based on the data.

Publish the analysis to QuickSight and share it with your team or stakeholders.

Here are more detailed steps for each of these:

Create an IAM role with permissions to access DynamoDB and QuickSight:
In the AWS Management Console, go to the IAM service and click "Roles" in the left navigation panel.
Click the "Create role" button.
Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity and choose "QuickSight" from the list of services.
Click "Next: Permissions".
Add the permissions you need for DynamoDB and QuickSight, such as "AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess" and "QuickSightFullAccess".
Click "Next: Tags" and "Next: Review".
Give the role a name and click "Create role".
Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to create a schema for the DynamoDB table:
In the AWS Management Console, go to the Glue service and click "Crawlers" in the left navigation panel.
Click the "Add crawler" button and give it a name.
Choose the data store type as "Amazon DynamoDB" and select the table you want to use.
Choose the IAM role you created in step 1 and click "Next".
Add any additional data stores or classifiers as needed and click "Next".
Review the crawler settings and click "Finish".
Run the crawler to create the schema for the DynamoDB table.
In QuickSight, create a new data source using the AWS Glue Data Catalog:
In the QuickSight console, click "Manage data" and then "New data source".
Select "AWS Glue Data Catalog" as the data source type.
Choose the Glue database and table you created in step 2.
Choose the IAM role you created in step 1 and click "Validate connection".
If the validation succeeds, click "Create data source".
In the QuickSight data source, create a new dataset using the fields from the DynamoDB table:
In the QuickSight console, go to the data source you created in step 3.
Click "New dataset".
Choose "Import data" and select the fields you want to use.
Use the data preparation tools to clean and transform the data as needed.
Click "Create dataset".
Create a new analysis in QuickSight and add the dataset to it:
In the QuickSight console, click "New analysis".
Choose the dataset you created in step 4.
Use the visualization tools to create charts and graphs based on the data.
Publish the analysis to QuickSight and share it with your team or stakeholders:
In the QuickSight console, click "Publish" to publish the
